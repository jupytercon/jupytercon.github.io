            <h3>Why should I join a sprint?</h3>
            <p>The best part of tech conferences is the people - and sprints are all about people. During the Sprint Event, you will have an opportunity to meet online, learn, and collaborate with peers from the Jupyter community. Not only will you be able to leave with a contributor badge, but you’ll also make new friends and contacts in the industry, public services, and academia.</p>

            <h3>How can I join the Sprint Event?</h3>
            <p>The sign-ups for sprint participants is still open in our <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jupytercon-2020-tickets-109183767588">tickets store</a> and they are <b>Free!</b>. We will email the intructions to join the platforms, and the schedule for the event a couple of days before the sprint day.</p>
            <p>
            <b>Attention:</b> If you didn't get the email, or decided to join last minute, make sure you register on <a href="https://academy.numfocus.org">academy.numfocus.org</a> using the same email address from your ticket, and then visit <a href="https://forum.numfocus.org">forum.numfocus.org</a>.

            Due to the online aspect of our sprint session, we are having a <i>kick-off</i> and <i>wrap-up</i> call for two different time zones groups:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Block A:</b> European/African time zones.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
            What about the transmissions?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Kick-off:</b> General introduction to our sprint day, and Projects will be doing short presentation for all the participants.</li>
                <li><b>Wrap-up:</b> What have we done during the day? Let's share our experiences!</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            Everyone is encouraged to participate in the full-day event! the transmissions are only to enable more people to hear about
            the projects and the progress during the day.

            Instructions to join our Mattermost server and to watch the transmission on YouTube will be send by email!
