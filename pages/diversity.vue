                <p>An inclusive environment at JupyterCon is a common resource. It is like air and water. By using Jupyter, within its extensive ecosystem, we are all participants and contributors and have the potential to positively impact our environment, both within the conference and the greater community.</p>

                <p>D&I touches every aspect of the conference, and we have various initiatives to promote diversity and inclusivity at JupyterCon. Below are some examples:</p>

                <p>What <strong>we at JupyterCon</strong> are doing:</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>Community outreach: we are conducting outreach with community groups to involve participants from all backgrounds. If your group would like to partner with us, email the JupyterCon Diversity Committee at <a href="jupytercon-diversity@numfocus.org">jupytercon-diversity@numfocus.org</a></li>
                    <li>Diversity scholarships</li>
